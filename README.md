# Summary # 

I've recently been disappointed with the lack of high quality influencer marketing customer relationship management software for digital subcultures. 

Existing options - Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest skew very heavy toward aggregated audiences, rather than targeting private digital subcultures. 

The monetization model drives the type of metrics that the CRM software will be measuring for. 

The problem is the advertising model of major social media companies measure engagement based on eyeballs / clicks. 

With a private membership fee, the success metrics will be driven less by vanity metrics, but more on the quality of of the experience. Productivity metrics, improvements in happiness, quality of life, significant improvement in craft. 

This different type of customer centric approach helps ensure that the user isn't the product.
